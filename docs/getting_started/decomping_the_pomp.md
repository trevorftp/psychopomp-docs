# Decomping the Pomp!
![Difficulty: Easy!](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4af31e89-ac18-43e8-bff0-a08152733da9)

Making maps and basic resource mods are fairly simple for Psychopomp in concept, but if you wish to go a bit beyond,
like say you want to make new models, game mechanics or new resources based on existing ones, you may want to have access to the game's files to use as references or a base.

Well, luckily there is an easy way for you to get access to those files: by decompiling the game!

!!! warning 
    While we show here how to decompile the game, DO NOT redistribute nor use these files for projects that are not mods or are unrelated to the game.
    You cannot use them in your own games and so on. Please, use common sense!!
